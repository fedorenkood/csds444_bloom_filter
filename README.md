# How to Run App
This application was developed based on the Django framework and with pipenv as package manager. \
Some packages may have prerequisites such as Postgres that will need to be installed separately. \
cd to csds444_bloom_filer/server\
run `pipenv shell`\
run `pipenv install`\
run `python manage.py runserver`

This will start a local web server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ where you can click on the "Sign Up" page to create an account. Details about our Bloom Filter and other security features are given in the report.
